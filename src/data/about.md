# Hello there!

Hi! I am Dennise! 👋

If you're here, then you might want to know me better? Here's some fun facts...

- I suck at games but I still play them. 💀
- I also suck at sports but I still play them. 🏐
- I occasionally experiment with cooking different kinds of dishes. 🍽️
- I am a man of a few words. If you see me yapping, I don't know what I am talking about. 🗣️

## Becoming a nerd...

I started programming when I was 10 or 11 years old. Can't remember exactly how old I was when I started.

It all began when I was in primary school, there was a program that I was using and there was things that I need that wasn't there. My curious little brain thought, why doesn't it have it? Can I make it myself? How can one make a program? It doesn't just appear from nothing right? From there, it snowballed into who I am today, a freaking nerd at computers. 😩
